### Personal Finance project

After graduating with Data Analysis course from Code Clan, I have decided to do analysis over one year of my bank transactions using new tools such as R and Shiny.
The user can explore and visualise the annual spends and gains by categories and monthly spends and gains by categories. The app has info boxes which point for the month and category with the highest spend/gain and table with top spends/gains over the chosen month.

### Final project at CodeClan

As part of Data Analysis course at Code Clan, I had to answer the client's questions through analysing the provided data. I chose Python to do the analysis. The client was the UK organisation which aims to protect animals. For the project I have built up prediction models using simple methods and Prophet package.
