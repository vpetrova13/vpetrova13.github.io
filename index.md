### Personal Finance project

After graduating with Data Analysis course from Code Clan, I have decided to do analysis over one year of my bank transactions using new tools such as R and Shiny.
The user can explore and visualise the annual spends and gains by categories and monthly spends and gains by categories. The app has info boxes which point for the month and category with the highest spend/gain and table with top spends/gains over the chosen month.

### Final project at CodeClan

As part of Data Analysis course at Code Clan, I had to answer the client's questions through analysing the provided data. I chose Python to do the analysis. The client was the UK organisation which aims to protect animals. For the project I have built up prediction models using simple methods and Prophet package.

### Group project at CodeClan

As part of Data Analysis course, we had to create a dashboard using RStudio and Shiny about Scotland's overall health state and particular health problem and how it changed over the last 5 - 10 years. Our particular health topic was focused on conditions that are caused by the abuse of alcohol. It shows geographically the difference of various rate of stays caused by different conditions related to alcohol (either mental or physical).

### Dirty data project at CodeClan

As part of Data Analysis course at CodeClan, I was asked to do at least 2 tasks out of 6 for the dirty data project (task 4 was mandatory). The aim of the project was to practice data cleaning skills since it is known that 80% of time in data science and analysis is spent data cleaning.
